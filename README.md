# AsyncUntangle

**AsyncUntangle** attempts to untangle some common async / await pitfalls.

> ## Background and History

A small preamble and history on **AsyncUntangle**. **AsyncUntangle** started as a small project for me to understand Roslyn analyzer fundamentals. Being a frequent victim of common async pitfalls and "code smells" myself, it seemed like the perfect place to start.

## The Problem & Value Proposition

Asynchronous programming with C# async/await is powerful but can be a source of significant challenges. Common "code smells" and anti-patterns can introduce subtle bugs, performance bottlenecks, and deadlocks that are difficult to diagnose. 

**AsyncUntangle** serves as a pedagogical tool, helping to developers to learn and understand pitfalls around async programming in real time as they code.
